# Write a function that calculates the number of ways to make an amount given a list of
# denominations.
# eg: how many ways can you make a dollar using standard US currency?
# inputs: (100, [1, 5, 10, 25, 50])

# This is a classic programming exercise.  See:
# https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html#%_sec_1.2.1
# (search for "counting change")

# Note: I find this exercise quite difficult, and have to look it up every time.  Even
# when I do, I'm not sure I "get it" in terms of expressing this recursively.
